# VanFP Meetup

## Haskell Workshop

We will work
through [_Haskell Programming from First Principles_](http://haskellbook.com/)
(aka the "Haskell Book") by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki. The only
prerequisites for participating are this book, a computer, and your person. An
open mind is also recommended. No prior experience with Haskell, functional
programming, or coding in general is required.

To prepare for your first visit, please do the following:

- **Join the [VanFP Meetup](https://www.vanfp.org), the [Vancouver Haskell Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Vancouver-Haskell-Unmeetup/) and the #hffp-workshop channel on yvrdev.slack.com.**
All announcements pertaining to this study group will be sent out via both
Meetups and Slack.

- **[Purchase](https://gumroad.com/l/haskellbook) your own copy of the book.**
You will need your own copy on your own machine so you can work with the PDF and
your terminal open side-by-side. This book was independently researched,
written, and published by two Haskell developers working in their spare time to
support education in functional programming. As a member of our strong and
supportive community, we know you are too committed to the spirit of pure
actions to "borrow" someone else's copy. They typeset it with LaTeX: give them a
break!

- **Install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/), the Haskell project development tool.**
If you are familiar with package managers like npm, pip, and apt, Stack is
similar. You needn't show up already an expert, but do at
least
[learn the basics](https://github.com/sjsyrek/berlin-functional-programming-group/blob/master/haskell-study-group/resources/haskell-stack-notes.md).
If you want to know everything, though, you could
watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw). The most
important thing: whatever you do, **_do not install the Haskell Platform_**.

- **Set up a project environment for your practice code, and familiarize yourself with GHC and GHCi.**
You don't need to do much more than create a directory for your code and make
sure you know how to run the GHC compiler on your source files and GHCi when you
need a REPL.

### Expectations

Participants in the study group will be expected to model and reinforce a
culture of accountability. This entails everyone abiding by the norms of a
supportive and rigorous classroom environment. Each week, you should complete
the following tasks:

- Do all the reading.
- Type in all the code.
- Attempt all the exercises.
- Attend the group meeting.
- Optional: Meet with a study partner to discuss your work, it is likely you
  will keep at it if you hold yourself accountable to a particular person.

These expectations are not meant to make your life miserable but to provide a
framework for your success. If you actually want to learn Haskell, consistency
is the key—as with anything else. Since we'll be learning Haskell together in
this group, it is essential that you work through each chapter on your own first
so that you come to each group meeting prepared, knowing what you need help with
and what you understand well enough to teach others. If you get stuck on a
problem, keep moving, but do not just skip the exercises entirely.
#### For the sake of emphasis: _do not skip the exercises!_

If you are a complete beginner to programming or for whatever reason have
trouble installing Haskell on your computer, don't worry about it! Come to the
study group, and we'll help you figure it out. Fortunately, you don't even need
a computer to work through Chapter 1—just pen, paper, and patience. So make sure
you at least do that much, even if you require tech support.

### Conduct of code

By participating in this study group, you implicitly agree to conduct your
coding as follows:

* You will purchase your own copy of the Haskell Book. Anyone suspected of using
  an illegal copy will be removed from the group immediately.

* Each week, prior to the group meeting, you will complete the assigned reading
  and attempt to complete the coding exercises to the best of your ability. If
  you do not make a genuine effort to complete your work, for whatever reason,
  you will not be permitted to join the group discussion that week. Participants
  who fail to complete their assignments twice in a row or three times total, or
  who are otherwise not making a good faith effort to keep up with the course
  schedule, may be asked to leave the group. If you find yourself struggling
  with the exercises, you should seek help at the meetings, from your study
  partner, or online.

* Participants who consistently miss meetings or RSVP without showing up will be
  removed from the group. If you cannot make it to a meeting, let our organizers
  know as soon as possible.

* In addition to the above, all study group participants are expected to make
  their best effort at being decent human beings. Participants whose behavior
  strays too far or too often beyond the reasonable boundaries of respect,
  kindness, and collegiality may be removed from the group at the discretion of
  the organizers.

### Format

We will work through chapters 1–11 of the Haskell Book over the course of 8
weeks, meeting for about one hour and half each week. We may extend the meeting
schedule to cover subsequent chapters if there is enthusiasm for doing so and
the coaches are available.

**This is not a class**, however, so do not come expecting a lecture. Instead,
you will have the opportunity to review your work and to discuss concepts and
exercises that gave you difficulty when working through the book on your own.

You are encouraged to hew as closely to this regular, weekly schedule as you are
able so as to maintain your momentum. That said, if life gets in the way, so be
it: but do your best to catch up, and avoid skipping any material as each
chapter builds on the last. We can always discuss exercises on Slack, but please
refrain from posting your solutions publicly (including on GitHub).

### Signing up

All meetings will be announced on Meetup and Slack. You must RSVP to attend each
meeting separately, as space is at a premium. If you cannot attend a meeting
because it is full, please continue to work on your own, and come to a future
meeting. Do not RSVP if you cannot attend. *No-shows will not be allowed to
attend subsequent meetings*.

### Schedule

The workshop is going to take place in Unbounce HQ every Monday from 6:00 pm to
7:30 pm starting on September 18th, 2017. The schedule can be found on the
[Landing Page](http://workshops.vanfp.org/haskell/#lp-pom-text-62)
